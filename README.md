# SRVHS Badminton Website
The source code to the SRVHS Badminton website.
Hi Kylie's mom and Arunan :)

TODO: Leave instructions for Isaac on how to change stuff like 
- How to change links in the link button section
- Add new pictures and sections on the gallery page

TODO: For me
- ~~Change picture of Arunan talking to something else because he won't like it~~
- ~~Separate badminton club and team into two separate pages (look at document for what to put)~~
- Sleep
- Pictures: I’ll help choose several of them and caption them. Maybe we can add the google photo links to the website to provide all of them?
- Change "be part of a community" image on home page (waiting for a better image, current ones kinda suck, lol)
- ~~Announcements: maybe add “and schedule”;~~ we could either somehow embed a calendar in or do it as coach did before on the old website (google calendar setup and embed) (could you also provide me with some events and their details so I could set up the calendar with actual information?)


TODO: Kylie stuff
- Pictures: I’ll help choose several of them and caption them. Maybe we can add the google photo links to the website to provide all of them? 
- Spellcheck stuff (if you want)

Note: Kylie and Isaac, check back here for stuff to do and to see stuff that I've fixed and add stuff to the list
