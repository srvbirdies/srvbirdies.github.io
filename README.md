Hi Kylie's mom :)

TODO: Leave instructions for Isaac on how to change stuff like 
- How to change links in the link button section
- Add new pictures and sections on the gallery page

TODO: For me
- Massive refactoring of CSS
- Add in responsive Bootstrap
- Comment more of the HTML (especially the stuff Isaac would need to edit)
- ~~Publish to Github Pages~~
- ~~Get images working~~
- Separate badminton club and team into two separate pages (look at document for what to put)
- Sleep

TODO: Kylie stuff
- Write one to two sentence descriptions for reasons to play badminton
- Come up with a catchy title that will make people want to scroll down
- Make some good text to encourage people to join the club and or the team
- Spellcheck stuff (if you want)
